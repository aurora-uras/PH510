# PH510
This repository is for the PH510 class at Strathclyde University

The code produced for the first assignment is named assignment1_mycode
The script used to run the code on wee-Archie can be found in the folder as script.sh.

As the course proceeds, different folders are created for different assignments. Assignment2 folder contains the MonteCarlo method developed, and the code used for the assignment, together with a new script to run everything on Wee-Archie.
